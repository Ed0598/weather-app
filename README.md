# Weather-app

Welcome on my Weather-App ! 

The project was done in three days. 
Using JavaScript and (Chart.js), HTML, SCSS, CSS 



Mission objectives : 

In this challenge you will use and consolidate your knowledge on:

- A typical HTTP flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the HTTP requests
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an api

The Mission :

You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.

Specifications :

ðŸŒ± Must haves
- In the home page the user can enter the city of their choice (think of the right HTML elements here)

- On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days

ðŸ’¡ Not sure where to start? Split this features into multiple smaller todos (in your code, sketch, ...)

ðŸŒ¼ Nice to haves (in no specific order): 
- Remember the user choice on subsequent visits
- Allow the user to compare the weather in multiple cities simultaneously
- Use the API of https://unsplash.com/ to show a photo of the city they entered in the form.
- Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as Chart.js
